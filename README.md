This project is a small Django recipe manager. It lets you create, view, edit, and delete recipes and their ingredients. Each recipe can have many ingredients because of a ForeignKey relationship. The app uses Django models, views, URLs, templates, and the admin panel. You run it with python manage.py runserver and it shows five sample recipes. The structure is simple: models store data, views handle requests, templates show pages, and URLs connect everything. You can add and remove ingredients, edit recipes, and use the admin dashboard. The project is clean, works well, and is easy for a small team.
